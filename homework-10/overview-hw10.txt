The purpose of Homework 10 challenged students to find an efficient and accurate search algorithm that is utilized as 
autocompleter function (similar to that of texting on phones).

File "main-hw10.cpp" includes instructor code that checks the student code. If the student code runs correctly, 
output will be "Assignment Complete" as well as an interactive mode that lets the client test out code (uncomment it out).
