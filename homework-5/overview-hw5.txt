The purpose of Homework 5 is to practically introduce pointers and add on to Homework 1. Here, we use a pointer 
to refer to a Pokedex.txt file that refers to every Pokemon's name, index, and type. The pokedex.cpp file allows 
for removal, addition, and finding of pokemon based on the pokedex.

File "main-hw5.cpp" includes instructor code that checks the student code. If the student code runs correctly, 
output will be "Assignment Complete".
