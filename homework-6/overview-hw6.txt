The purpose of Homework 6 is to practically introduce Queues. This script acts like a game queue where players
wait to be paired with other players based on a role they chose (i.e. Defender, Hunter, Bard) and be grouped
with other players as a complete team. 

File "main-hw6.cpp" includes instructor code that checks the student code. If the student code runs correctly, 
output will be "Assignment Complete".
