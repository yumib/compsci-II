# compsci-II
This is a culmination of my former Computer Science II homework. Some topics include Stacks, Queues, Search and Sort Algorithms, Linked Lists, Binary Trees, and were practically applied through real-life scenarios.

When completing the homework, efficiency, and object-oriented coding were utilized to achieve the best result. 
All assignments were originally coded on Replit and have been moved to GitHub for exhibition.
